<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then exit into the sewer or septic tank from your home. When you experience blockages in multiple drains simultaneously in your home, then that usually implies that your main sewer line is supporting. This can take place in multiple areas and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is potential for the contaminated water to become a health risk if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
