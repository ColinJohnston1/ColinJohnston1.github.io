When those downspouts are connected to underground drains that flow to municipal storm drains or street seamless gutters, they in some cases end up being clogged with tree roots and particles. These types of blockages trigger gutters to overflow and the weight of the water can cause rain gutters to retreat from a house while inflicting water damage and rot to the structure. Please note that Roto-Rooter does unclean roofing rain gutters or rectangular aluminum rain gutter downspouts.</p>
