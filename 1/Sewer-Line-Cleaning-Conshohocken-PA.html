<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Mechanical water softening units are for that reason likewise called ion exchange water softeners.
