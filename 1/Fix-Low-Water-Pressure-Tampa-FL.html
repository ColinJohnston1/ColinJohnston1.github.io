When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions.

The response is: you need backflow prevention if you have a culinary water connection that may be utilized to provide a sprinkler system.</p>
<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the regular direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need.
