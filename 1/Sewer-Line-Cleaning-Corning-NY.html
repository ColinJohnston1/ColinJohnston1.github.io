I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole.
