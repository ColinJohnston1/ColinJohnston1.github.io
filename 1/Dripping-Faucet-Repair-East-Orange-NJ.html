A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived during the appointed period. They unplugged the sinks, cleaned up and suggested a tool to be used in the future.</p>

Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century.

Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
