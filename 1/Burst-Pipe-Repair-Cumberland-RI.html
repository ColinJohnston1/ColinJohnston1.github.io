<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has area to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by hanging on to the weaker charged sodium ions.

<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the residential or commercial property or condo board. Owners and boards of structures that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should submit plans with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notification of Violation will be sent out. Lawbreakers will be accountable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually lead to criminal and civil actions and procedures, along with the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
