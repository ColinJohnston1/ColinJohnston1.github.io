<p>When, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be wrapped, however should then shift to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that need to be. It is also enabled to use black iron if it is most likely covered with a galvanized coating (which is basically an unique paint"). When plumbing in their gas meters, PG&E often does this.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or walkways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a container under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
