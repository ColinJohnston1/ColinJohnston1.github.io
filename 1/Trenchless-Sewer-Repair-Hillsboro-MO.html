<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange.

<p>When the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers should only be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the workings of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if required, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
