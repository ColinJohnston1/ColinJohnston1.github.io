<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain correctly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can help. In some cases drain repair requirements can be resolved reasonably rapidly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain may need to be dismantled, examined, and cleared before being changed. Sometimes, a handyman may determine that a replacement part is essential (like a reducer, tailpiece, or pvc  trap) to ensure normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to discuss repair alternatives.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, heater, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these little deposits are harmless, but with time they build up and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>

<p>When compared to gas designs, electrical designs are much easier and less expensive to install as electricity is currently offered through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a specific gas line needs to be set up and a viable source of gas established. Another feature of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation. Gas designs need to be aerated correctly utilizing vents and ducts in order to work properly. With electric models, you will not need to install any new vents or ducts in your house.</p>
