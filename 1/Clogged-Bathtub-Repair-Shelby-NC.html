<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply.

Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
