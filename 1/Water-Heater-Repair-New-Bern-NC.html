<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the faulty pipes changed.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for many years, but steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
