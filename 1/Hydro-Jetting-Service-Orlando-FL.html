<p>1. Install a hair-stopper - Hair-stoppers work simply as their name suggests. They stop long hair from entering and obstructing your shower drain. More often than not, our Torrance drain cleaning specialists are hired to clean a shower drain that wouldn't need cleaning if there were a hair-stopper installed. Gas leakages can harm residential or commercial property and owners end up paying high gas leak repair expenses. This can be prevented by conducting annual inspections of the gas lines to keep your home safe.
