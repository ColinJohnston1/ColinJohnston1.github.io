<p>Due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had a chance to become covered inside, New houses constructed with copper pipes are especially vulnerable to corrosive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
