<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede against the needed direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can become polluted. If allowed to return to the supply of water, there is capacity for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
