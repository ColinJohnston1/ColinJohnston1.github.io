So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers handle all kinds of work. Their tasks break out into two categories: Plumbers who manage fundamental repairs (often in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who focus on remodeling additions and tasks.</p>
