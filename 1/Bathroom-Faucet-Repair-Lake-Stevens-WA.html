<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe might allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

This is the very first barrier in the Cedar Rapids Water Division's multi-barrier disinfection procedure.</p>
