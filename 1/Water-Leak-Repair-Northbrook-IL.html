<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an alternative to think about if you live in an older home - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.
