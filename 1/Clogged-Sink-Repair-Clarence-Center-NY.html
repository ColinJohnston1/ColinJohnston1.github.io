Fire security system are developed to match the hazard that exists in the places they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be really various, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to satisfy that particular risk or need. An airplane hangar will need a really different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would likewise vary greatly.</p>
