If so preferred, this will not preclude the licensee from obtaining permits and inspections for such work.</p>

<p>Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline prior to the problem worsened. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really pricey option.</p>
