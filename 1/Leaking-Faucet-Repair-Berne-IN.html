<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or condominium board. Owners and boards of structures that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer must file plans with the DEP within one month. If the DEP has not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Offense will be sent out. Lawbreakers will be accountable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually result in civil and criminal procedures and actions, along with the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
