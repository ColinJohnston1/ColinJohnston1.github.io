<p>Hidden water leaks are typically difficult and have Possibly Severe Repercussions. Changing your flapper may need a little different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but possibilities are you'll find one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
