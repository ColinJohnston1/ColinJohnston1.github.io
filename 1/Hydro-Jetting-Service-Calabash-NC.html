Total expenses vary from $200 to $1,000 or more depending on the length of piping needed to link to the main gas supply, which generally averages 30'.</p>
<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>A plumbing license attends to three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each.
