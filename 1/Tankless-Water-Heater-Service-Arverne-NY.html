<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, along with examined annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
