<p>There are a few kinds of hot water heater to pick from, each style has its advantages and disadvantages. The best one for you depends upon just how much hot water you use, and the heating method (electrical energy, gas, oil).

The trade-off is that the preliminary costs are greater and your return on investment will take longer.</p>
