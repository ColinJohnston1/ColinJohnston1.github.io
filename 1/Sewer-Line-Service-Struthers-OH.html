<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Struthers OH</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
