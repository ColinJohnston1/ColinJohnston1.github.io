<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace.

The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
