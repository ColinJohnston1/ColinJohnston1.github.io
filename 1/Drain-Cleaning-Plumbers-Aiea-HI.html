To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.)

When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
