<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Statham GA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
