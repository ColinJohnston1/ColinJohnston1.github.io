<p>The most reliable way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Mixing vaporized salt with rock salt is not recommended, as this could clog the softening reservoir. It is suggested that you permit your unit to go empty of one type of salt prior to adding another to avoid the incident of any problems. In any case, when you're preparing a water heater replacement, play it safe. Call your local department of inspections and ask if you need a license. And make certain a plumbing or electrical inspector checks your work.</p>
