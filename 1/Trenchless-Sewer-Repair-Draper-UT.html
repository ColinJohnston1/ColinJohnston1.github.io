However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers carry just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models.

At the least, it would have been a really costly option.</p>
