<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If enabled to re-enter the water supply, there is capacity for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as examined yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
