If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>

It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
