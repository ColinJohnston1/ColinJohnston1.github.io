<h3>How To Keep A Blocked Toilet From Becoming A Plumbing Catastrophe at Woods Cross UT</h3>

The City requires backflow prevention gadgets to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that might permit tainted water into the City system or private plumbing.

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.
