<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace.

It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
