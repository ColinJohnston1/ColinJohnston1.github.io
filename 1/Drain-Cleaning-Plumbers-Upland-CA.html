<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in numerous parts of the plumbing system, many frequently in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow problems or perhaps stop a component from flowing entirely. The next typical problem that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so severe that it decreases the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from becoming an issue in your water supply by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to join together, forming clusters that ultimately form stable crystals. These crystals do not cling to surface areas like specific minerals would.</p>

Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Most high-pressure water jetters will run with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
