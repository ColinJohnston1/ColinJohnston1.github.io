<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Odessa MO</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain service technician to use a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to repair the drain and identify issue. This kind of camera is especially helpful in finding a problem if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system.</p>

There are a couple of others that I will discuss but do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on a certification test, I discuss them only.</p>
