Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
