<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If permitted to return to the supply of water, there is capacity for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, as well as inspected each year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
