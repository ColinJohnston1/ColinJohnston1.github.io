Commercial assemblies should be evaluated every year.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Image 1. Water is most likely escaping through a cracked or corroded overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running sound. In that case, you need to separate the tank from the bowl and replace the entire flush valve. Given that the overflow tube is rarely the reason for a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>
