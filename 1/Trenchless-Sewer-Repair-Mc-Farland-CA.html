<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. An action crew is offered for preliminary investigation of sewer emergencies every day of the year. If sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system supports through sinks or toilets, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700. City employees will inspect and get rid of blockages in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is responsible for. If the problem is the outcome of excessive storm water in the system, you may have to wait until the storm has actually gone away to have the backup solved.</p>
<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the regular instructions from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need.
