<p>When selecting the appropriate system security there are numerous considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be looked at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are developed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are installed in. As building types and contents of these structures can be really various, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to satisfy that specific danger or need. An aircraft garage will need a very various fire protection system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also vary greatly.</p>
