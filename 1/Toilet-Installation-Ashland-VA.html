<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
