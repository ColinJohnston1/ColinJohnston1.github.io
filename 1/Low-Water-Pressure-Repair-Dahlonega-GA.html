<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Contractor in Dahlonega</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>We concentrate on tub and shower replacement and complete bathroom redesigning at really competitive rates. Switch on the gas and inspect connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. Wipe the joints dry when completed. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work. Follow the how-to advice that accompanies the pictures to make sure the connections are tight.</p>
<p>As water runs through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water dishwasher, boiler, and heater, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. In the beginning, these small deposits are harmless, however with time they build up and eventually clog pipes, seize valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly limit the water flow, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
