In some cases, however, the damage is so substantial that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so big that replacement is simply a more practical option. This normally involves cracks in the toilet bowl itself, widespread deterioration over numerous components, or merely because you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
