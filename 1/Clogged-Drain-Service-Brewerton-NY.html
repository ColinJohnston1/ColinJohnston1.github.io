<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
