<p>Other than water trickling and the occasional creak, your pipes need to not be making any odd noises, particularly not ones loud enough to keep you up during the night. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious noises, that's a proven sign of a bigger issue. Have your pipes checked as quickly as possible so you don't end up with a major leak.</p>
