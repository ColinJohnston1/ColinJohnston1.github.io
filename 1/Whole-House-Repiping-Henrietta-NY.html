Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, complimentary" salt ions are released into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends upon the hardness of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to eliminate solidity.</p>
<p>When the data gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually degraded in its performance listed below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers should only be repaired.

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
