<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Massapequa Park NY</h3>
<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion refers to what takes place when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs because the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might result in substantial residential or commercial property damage. Look out for wet, green patches in your backyard, a relentless sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all typical signs of root invasion.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
