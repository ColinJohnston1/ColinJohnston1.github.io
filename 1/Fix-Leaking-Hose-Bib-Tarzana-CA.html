<p>Visible smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your house or service place, offer us a call. That odor may be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair work right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will typically need to be changed rather than fixed. You'll know this if your pipes are gurgling or producing foul smells.</p>
