<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
