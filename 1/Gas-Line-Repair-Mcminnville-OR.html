<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey.

The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
