In addition, SACr is a major advancement over present anti-scaling technologies including template assisted condensation by permitting the real physical decrease of calcium and magnesium ion concentrations. Your kitchen may end up being clogged by food or grease, while in the bathroom it might be hair or pieces of soap that cause the obstruction.

<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to eliminate the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring positive charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions.
