<p>While many hot water heater problems can be efficiently repaired, some issues will necessitate complete hot water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its typical lifespan (usually anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a significant leak or substantial rust, it may be time to consider replacement.</p>
<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last couple of years. A great rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: because the life-span of the average hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>Before choice and installation, refer to makers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies need to be secured from freezing temperatures and if set up where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be utilized. Consult manufacturers specifications for recommendations. When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your needs and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses associated with a plumbing contractor.</p>
