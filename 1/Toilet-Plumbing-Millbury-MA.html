<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
