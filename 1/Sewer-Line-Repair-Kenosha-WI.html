<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water stains and rust.
