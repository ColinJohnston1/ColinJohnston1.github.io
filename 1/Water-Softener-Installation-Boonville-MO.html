If your pipes are gurgling or discharging nasty odors, you'll know this.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your system is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- make sure your disposal switch remains in the off" position prior to you plug the new unit in.
