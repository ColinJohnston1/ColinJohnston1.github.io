<p>Since of a concern at the point of installation or since of maintenance, water softeners leakages are mainly triggered. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced gradually. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely cracked and simply needs to be replaced.</p>
