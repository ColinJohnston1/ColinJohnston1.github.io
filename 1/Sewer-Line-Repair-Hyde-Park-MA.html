As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a duration of 3 to five months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Hyde Park MA</h3>
<p>In the majority of states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your home from our gas meter to your home or business.

<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
