All assemblies must be secured from freezing temperature levels and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be used. Speak with manufacturers specifications for recommendations. When looking for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your needs and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses associated with a plumbing contractor.</p>
