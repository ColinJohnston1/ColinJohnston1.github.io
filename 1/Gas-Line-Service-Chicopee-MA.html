<p>Leakages can take place if the seal in between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain fails. Because the tank or the entire toilet must be raised off the floor for a correct repair, either of these leaks can be hard to fix by yourself.

<p>There are a couple of dead giveaways that will let you know you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is essential to focus on them. If you observe a strong odor that resembles rotten eggs, then the gas pipe might be pierced or damaged. You might also hear a hissing noise as the gas is escaping from the line, however that isn't constantly the case. If you smell rotten eggs, it is necessary to do something about it rapidly to prevent any severe problems and to keep everybody safe.</p>

Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Numerous homes in my neighborhood being repiped and have actually talked to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this.
