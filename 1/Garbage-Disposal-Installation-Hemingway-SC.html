<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
