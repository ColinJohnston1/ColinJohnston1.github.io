The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a forecasted life-span of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another reliable technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination.
