<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your house. Even if the issue comes from with the municipal system, it's still wise to bring in the experts to restrict the damage to your house.</p>
<p>There are 2 kinds of materials used to develop a waste disposal unit unit: aluminum and stainless-steel. The typical cost of an aluminum waste disposal unit varies from $60 to $150, while a stainless steel waste disposal unit has a typical cost of just over $150. Sewer pipes can be infamously challenging to trace, particularly on older homes, so you'll want to work with somebody who will trace the issue at its origin.</p>
