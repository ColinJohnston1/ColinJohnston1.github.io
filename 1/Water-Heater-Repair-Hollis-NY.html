<p>Daily use must not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise take place if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener does not tip over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you must wait until after the cycle is completed and after that checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You should also inspect to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
