<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or illness.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Short article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water system into the general public water system. This can happen at any time, such as throughout a water pipe break or throughout a large firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Other indications you might need to repipe consist of rust in your water system, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail signs that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily indicate repiping is the only solution. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to figure out the best course of action.</p>
