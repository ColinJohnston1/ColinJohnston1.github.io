<p>Inside the home, check the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leakages or drips. Inspect below sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber priced estimate cost of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I checked around. Under the sink, put a container or pan beneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to disconnect the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain.
