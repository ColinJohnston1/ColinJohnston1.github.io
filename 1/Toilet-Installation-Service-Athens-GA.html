<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Athens GA</h3>
<p>Our licensed plumbing service technicians can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by linking a hose to drain the tank to an appropriate drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner might supply a fast fix in the short-term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. An excellent location to begin trying to find the leaking kitchen sink plumbing unit is underneath the puddle of water or where you seem to feel the wetness most.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health risk if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's a long-term service for the whole plumbing system in your home or business. We shut off the water supply, get rid of old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the new system is installed, we turn the water on and perform tests on the new system. Once the system passes our tests, it's good to go for you.</p>
<p>We highly recommend New Circulation Plumbing. There was a leak in our kitchen that was ruining our laminate floor. New Flow came out and repaired the leak on the day we called. They were on time and extremely professional. They also addressed their phones and returned call in a prompt way. Our group will suggest the very best toilet suitable for your space and spending plan to guarantee the installation is done correctly. Whether you're changing old toilets for a more eco-friendly way of life or a broken toilet has led you to the replacement, call us for our toilet installation services.</p>
