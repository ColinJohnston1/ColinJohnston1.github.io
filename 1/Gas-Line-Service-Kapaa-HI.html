<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Kapaa HI</h3>
<p>Older plumbing systems may have pipes that corrode with time, causing leaks or other problems. Furthermore, rust or other accumulations in the pipes can limit air flow and make it difficult to utilize one or more of your gas-powered home appliances like the clothes dryer or stove. Based on research performed by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Study, 2011.</p>
<p>As discussed previously in the article, carbon monoxide gas is totally odorless and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home needs to have carbon monoxide gas detectors installed at the correct locations. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are generally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
