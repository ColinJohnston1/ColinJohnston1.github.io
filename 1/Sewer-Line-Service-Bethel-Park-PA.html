<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as hard water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mostly time related. If everything is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be customized, replaced, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the total expenses. The majority of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with many disposal installations running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
