<p>Drain pipe is not secured using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe need to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not in fact glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is actually a solvent that melts the surface areas of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are split, pierced or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
