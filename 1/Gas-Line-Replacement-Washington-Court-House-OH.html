<p>In many cases, our technicians will suggest that you replace your water heater instead of buy repairs.

<p>Since the copper pipes have not had a chance to become coated inside, New homes developed with copper pipes are especially susceptible to destructive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a duration of 3 to five months after occupancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
