<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, utilize the convenient self-service wrenchette to disengage the old system from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it totally free. Several homes in my area being repiped and have spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Obviously it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't identified quickly.</p>
