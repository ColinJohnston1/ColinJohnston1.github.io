Toilet Runs Periodically - Do not you hate it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It usually implies there is a concern with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water someplace.</p>
<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube.
