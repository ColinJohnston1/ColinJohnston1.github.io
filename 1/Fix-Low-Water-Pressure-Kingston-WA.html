<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for citizens. If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help figure out.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear space will be kept above the assembly to permit servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves.
