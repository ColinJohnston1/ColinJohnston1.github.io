Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>There are several indications to watch out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm or perhaps hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all devices and components in your home have actually been turned off. 3) The hot water heater seems to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to greater gas and water bills, in some cases extremely quickly.</p>
