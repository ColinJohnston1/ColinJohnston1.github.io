<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
