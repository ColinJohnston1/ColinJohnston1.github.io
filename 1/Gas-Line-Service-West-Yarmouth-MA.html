<p>When selecting the correct system defense there are a number of considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be looked at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the threat that exists in the locations they are installed in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be developed and set up to fulfill that specific threat or need. An airplane hangar will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also differ greatly.</p>

<p>A minimum of once every 3 months, drain water from the tank.
