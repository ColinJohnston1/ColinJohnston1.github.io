<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain.

<p>Water heater repair and hot water heater installation are often delayed as long as possible. A water heater is a costly plumbing home appliance, and we tend to press off replacing it till it breaks beyond repair. It is also a piece of plumbing devices that we ignore until we wake up to a cold shower. We might hear the hot water heater making noise, trying to tell us there is a problem, but we disregard it which might cause a more substantial repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It's important to go out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to a concern, the much better chance you'll need to conserve time and money on water heater services.</p>
