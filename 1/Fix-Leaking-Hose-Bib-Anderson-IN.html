<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to rust.

As the external finish of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
