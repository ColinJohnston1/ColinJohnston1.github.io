<p>Often called an auger, this convenient tool can clear blockages that might be stuck even more down the system. You'll have to take apart the drainpipe and P-trap that runs underneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that takes a trip behind the cabinet wall. This is where you insert the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to separate the clog.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, use or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be evaluated occasionally to guarantee they are operating correctly. A visual check of air spaces suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with appropriately calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
