One common method for a house's water supply to be polluted is if the irrigation water lines, which could end up being tainted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. The issue could spread out exponentially if that contaminated water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private houses, it likewise prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
