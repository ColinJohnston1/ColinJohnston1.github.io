<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Natick MA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best service to all of these problems.</p>

They were prompt and very responsive to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were extremely professional and did an awesome job.

Now, if this staining just appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still a problem that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a new water heater) however not one that requires repiping.</p>
