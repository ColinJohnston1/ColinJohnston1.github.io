<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening simply gets rid of firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>Water softeners can be found in all sizes and shapes and bigger definitely does not imply much better. WaterBoss ® uses fine mesh resin - smaller beads that really supply more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also secure the resin bed, so we do not need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that allow a churning of resin during regrowth to launch sediment, dirt and hardness.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working garbage disposal, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will usually recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the seriousness of the circumstance. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has actually raised water levels, is making gurgling sounds, smells nasty, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
