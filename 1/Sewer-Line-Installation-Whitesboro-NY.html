<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

<h3>Is Your Water Heater Leaking? Find Out What You Should Do in Whitesboro NY</h3>
<p>From tubs and showers clogged with hair and soap buildup to sinks filled with toothpaste and other grime, restrooms present numerous difficulties when it comes to keeping drains clear and totally free. Even toilets can be overwhelmed with toilet tissue or non-flushable products. No matter the challenge, Roto-Rooter plumbers have all the devices required to resolve clogged bathroom drains and can provide skilled sewer cleaning and drain cleaning services.</p>
<p>Frequent leaks: Leaks originating from your water heater are never an excellent indication. If your hot water heater has frequent leakages or is continuously needing repairs, it is likely more cost-efficient to replace the entire unit. A backflow preventer is a device that's set up on your home's pipes that allows water to stream in one direction but never ever in the opposite direction. Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a momentary fix. It's a long-term option for the whole plumbing system in your home or business. We shut off the water supply, get rid of old pipe and replace it with brand-new pipe. After the new system is set up, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the new system. As soon as the system passes our tests, it's great to choose you.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
