<h3>Efficient Services Of Plumber Buford GA</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>To determine if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are generally blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Often, it gets in the home near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is attached to the end of the water main. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have actually discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
