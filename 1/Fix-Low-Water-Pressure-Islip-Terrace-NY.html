<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water spots and corrosion.
