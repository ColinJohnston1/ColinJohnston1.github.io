<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather security. As the outer covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>If the work installed by the permit holder is authorized by the inspector, the license holder if requested, will receive a Certificate of Acceptance from the plumbing division. If you're not comfortable making electrical connections for your waste disposal unit installation, you can buy a disposal that already has a cable connected. Ask at your house center or home appliance shop, or search online for 'waste disposal unit with cord connected.</p>
