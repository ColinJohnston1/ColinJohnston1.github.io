<h3>Affordable Plumbing Services Warrensburg MO</h3>
<p>Lots of toilet problems, consisting of leaking toilets, do not demand fixing the whole toilet. Like any home appliance, a toilet tank features numerous little moving parts that may need changed with usage in time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and trigger toilet leakages that aren't plainly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

That odor may be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair right now.
