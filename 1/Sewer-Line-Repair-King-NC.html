<h3>Frozen Pipes in King North Carolina</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles decreased the recently cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and perseverance the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
