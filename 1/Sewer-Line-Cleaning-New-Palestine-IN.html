<p>Badly installed gas lines cause gas leakages. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating and cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>

These leaks are exceptionally inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
