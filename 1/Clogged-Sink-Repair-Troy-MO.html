Current modifications to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are directly planned for human water intake are required to be made with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass material.

<p>Backflow preventers need to just be fixed when the data gathered from the field test shows the assembly has degraded in its performance listed below the developed minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if necessary, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
