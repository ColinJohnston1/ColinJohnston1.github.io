<p>Polybutylene utilized inside your home can be found near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed sinks or toilets. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when exiting the wall. Just because copper is revealing does not indicate you do not have polybutylene pipes. You might need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.

After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the brand-new system. As soon as the system passes our tests, it's great to opt for you.</p>

Loosen the coupling nut that links the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Tip: Toss a towel on the floor below to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
