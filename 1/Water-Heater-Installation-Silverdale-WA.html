<p>Back-siphonage is backflow triggered by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a Public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply.

<p>Place the flange on the top of the sink, and attach the fastening system on the underside (Image 1). It is valuable to apply pressure on the flange from above using a second set of hands or a heavy item. This will keep the flange in location while connecting the attaching system below. Make sure the plumber's putty is noticeably oozing beyond the edge of the flange all around (Image 2). When a complete seal has formed, eliminate the excess putty with a rag.</p>

<p>Handheld sprayer. Leaks can often develop on the water lines for handheld sprayers that are attached to the kitchen sink. Water will drip into the cabinet beneath if the leak is far enough down the water line.

<p>Nevertheless, UPC model code needs stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to accomplish the very same level of defense as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire security system supplied by a drinkable water supply, increased defense is likewise required.
