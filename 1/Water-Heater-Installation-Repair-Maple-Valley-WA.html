Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
