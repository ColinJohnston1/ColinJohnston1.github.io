<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its lots of intended uses around your home.</p>
<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners sell these days. A liner is a cloth tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Service providers then normally blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your home was built before the 1970s or hasn't been remodeled, you will probably have old pipes that need replacing.</p>
