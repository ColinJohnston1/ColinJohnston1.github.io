<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. In some cases during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin areas leak right away and sometimes those leaks come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
