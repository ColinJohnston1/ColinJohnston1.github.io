The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>

<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually needed several repairs over the last few years. A good general rule for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the lifespan of the average water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is normal in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
