<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can present problems.</p>
