<p>In the meantime, nevertheless, we recommend you very first shot utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. Much of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really hazardous if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the suitable precautions.</p>
