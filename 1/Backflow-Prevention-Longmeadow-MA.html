<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. A permit is not needed for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
<p>If left unrepaired, a leaking water heater can trigger more major problems. They can also threaten and can lead to mold or perhaps damage to the structure of your home. That's why you need to never ever delay a repair. A professional plumber will be able to accurately find the source of the leak and suggest the best service.
