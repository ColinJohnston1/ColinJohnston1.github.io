<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Steubenville OH</h3>
<p>Gas is a crucial energy we use every day to keep our homes and workplaces warm, our showers hot, and to prepare our food. With the everyday usage of gas, it is understandable it is easy to understand that over time a leak is bound to occur.

<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
