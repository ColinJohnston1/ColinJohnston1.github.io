<p>For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause an obstruction or can trigger rust that blocks the line.

<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
