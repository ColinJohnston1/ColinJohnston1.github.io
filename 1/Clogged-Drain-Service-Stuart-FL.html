<p>The Last Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet.

After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed appropriately, you may experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in squandered water.</p>
