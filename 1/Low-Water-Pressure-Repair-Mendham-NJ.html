<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our market and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
