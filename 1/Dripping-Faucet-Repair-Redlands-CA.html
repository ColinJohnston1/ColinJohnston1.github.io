<h3>How Preemptive Drain Cleaning Can Benefit A Homeowner in Redlands CA</h3>

If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.
