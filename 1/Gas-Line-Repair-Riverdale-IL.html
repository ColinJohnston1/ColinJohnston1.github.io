<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
