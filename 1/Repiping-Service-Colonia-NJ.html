<p>The source or location of a sewer issue determines who pays for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon before it can occur, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to prevent backflow range from the fairly easy to the complex and really advanced.</p>
