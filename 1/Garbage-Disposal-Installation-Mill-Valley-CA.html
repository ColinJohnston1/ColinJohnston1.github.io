<p>There are a couple of types of hot water heater to choose from, each design has its disadvantages and advantages. The very best one for you depends on just how much hot water you use, and the heating technique (electrical energy, gas, oil). Some claim to decrease energy expenses by as much as 50 percent of conventional storage designs. The compromise is that the preliminary costs are higher and your return on investment will take longer.</p>

<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush.
