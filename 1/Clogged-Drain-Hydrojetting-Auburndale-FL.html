I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
