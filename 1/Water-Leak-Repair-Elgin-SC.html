Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a predetermined schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water really requires it. Newer units utilize computerized sensors that keep an eye on bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water use and therefore just regrow when needed.
