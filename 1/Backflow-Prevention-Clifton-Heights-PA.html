<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Clifton Heights PA</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
