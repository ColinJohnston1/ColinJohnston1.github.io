<p>As described previously in the post, carbon monoxide is completely odor free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide gas detectors set up at the proper areas.

They are typically sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups must have a 10-year non-serviceable kind of detector.</p>
