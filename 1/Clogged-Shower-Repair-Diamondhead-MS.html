<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close.
