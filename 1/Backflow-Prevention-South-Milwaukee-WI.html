<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you choose does not have a bypass, then it's wise to construct one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to maintain the system.</p>
