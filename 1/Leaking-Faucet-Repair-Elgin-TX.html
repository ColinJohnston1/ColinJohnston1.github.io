To discover an ideal replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however possibilities are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
