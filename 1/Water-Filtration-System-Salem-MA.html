<p>For shallow pipes without any nearby energies or obstructions, digging through and replacing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or sidewalks, dig-free pipe lining could conserve you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a bucket under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then get rid of the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
