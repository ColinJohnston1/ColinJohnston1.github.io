While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
