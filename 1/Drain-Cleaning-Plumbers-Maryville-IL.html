<p>Backflow is dangerous because it can contaminate the public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and damaging chemicals. In 2010, for example, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky grade school suffered queasiness and other signs after a contractor working on the HEATING AND COOLING system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>The toilet takes an actually long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout regular operation, the pressure in between the two check valves-- described as the zone of reduced pressure-- is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the outdoors, guaranteeing backflow never occurs.</p>
