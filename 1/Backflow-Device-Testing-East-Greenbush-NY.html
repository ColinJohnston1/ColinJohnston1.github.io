<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to company? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have.
