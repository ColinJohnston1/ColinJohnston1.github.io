<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
