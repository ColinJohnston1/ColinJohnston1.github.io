<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull strategy and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the usage of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into place. All brand-new replacement pipes have a predicted lifespan of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By placing a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
