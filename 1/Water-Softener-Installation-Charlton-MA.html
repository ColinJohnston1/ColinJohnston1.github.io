As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of intended usages around your home.</p>
