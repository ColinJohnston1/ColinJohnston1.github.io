<p>IRWD is dedicated to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our comprehensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water provided to our clients is kept devoid of damaging impurities. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment containing a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can take place through a process called backflow.</p>

Leaving the task to a qualified plumber makes sure a smooth installation process.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to avoid backflow. The basic ways of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>So, if you want to stop having to jiggle your toilet handle each time you flush and are exhausted and ill of publishing polite signs in your bathroom everytime you have individuals over, get a new trip lever that in fact works for your toilet.
