<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to overstated marketing and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening just eliminates solidity minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual preference not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a big red flag that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
