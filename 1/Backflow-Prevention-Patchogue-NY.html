<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
