<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most elaborate and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. Plumbing problems aren't simply difficult to detect, they're likewise efficient in causing some major damage.
