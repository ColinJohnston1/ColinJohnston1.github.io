<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most devastating and widespread water problems: tough water.  Tough water damaged the modern house. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and reducing water pressure.  Scale drastically shortens the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice devices. Hard water damages hot water appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>

<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. There is capacity for the polluted water to become a health risk if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for effectiveness, along with checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
