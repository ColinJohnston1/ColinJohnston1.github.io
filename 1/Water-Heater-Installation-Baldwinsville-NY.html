<p>Plumbers charge $75 to $150 to install a gas line sediment trap. Sediment traps capture wetness and sediment so that they don't go into the control unit. Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install.

These devices undergo testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they undergo regular tests later, too.</p>

After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.
