<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal system.

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest double flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
