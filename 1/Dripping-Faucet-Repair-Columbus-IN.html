<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Standard tank-type hot water heater consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large storage tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and then released into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you go beyond a predetermined level. You'll likewise discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
