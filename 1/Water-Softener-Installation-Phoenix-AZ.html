Every Benjamin Franklin Plumbing is locally owned and run, so you'll get a group that's invested in your community. Each of our plumbers is highly-skilled, thoroughly trained, and ready to offer the best experience possible for customers.

<p>Eliminate itchy rashes and experience smoother, softer skin and hair with a point-of-use shower head water softener. These models connect to or replace your existing shower head to stabilize the pH of your water, stop scale from forming, and filter out minerals. The majority of people dump food waste in the garbage, which suggests more garbage to go in land fills or be incinerated. Besides being bad for the environment, it's often foul-smelling and frequently utilizes plastic bags to bring the waste. Worse, food waste can ferment in landfills instead of breaking down.</p>
<p>When a waste disposal unit breaks, it is most likely only a matter of time before your sink begins to clog, as you and other home members are most likely not used to making sure that no obstructive food waste decreases your drain. Those dissolved solids can trigger a flaky buildup on whatever from dishes, to pipes, to the heating aspects of your home appliances, to your own body. Soap residue and clogged, corroded plumbing are normally the result of tough water.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
