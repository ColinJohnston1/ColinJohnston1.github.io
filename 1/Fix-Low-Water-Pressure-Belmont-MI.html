<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have children, you might not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. There's a great opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
