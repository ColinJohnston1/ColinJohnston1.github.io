<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these problems.</p>
<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or apartment board. Owners and boards of buildings that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit plans with the DEP within 30 days. If the DEP has not received certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notice of Violation will be sent. Lawbreakers will be liable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately cause civil and criminal proceedings and actions, in addition to the termination of water service to the building.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
