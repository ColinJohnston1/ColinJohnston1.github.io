For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of deterioration control. Thus, considering all these factors, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
