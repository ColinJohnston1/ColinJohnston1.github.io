<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts.

If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
