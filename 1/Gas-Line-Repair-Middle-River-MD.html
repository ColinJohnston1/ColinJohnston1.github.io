<p>Obvious smell. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or business area, give us a call. That smell may be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and regulates atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be replaced rather than repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or giving off foul odors, you'll know this.</p>

<p>Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a very pricey option.</p>
