<h3>Do's And Don'ts Of Emergency Plumbing Troubles La Grange NC</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening.

Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Irrigation backflow prevention assemblies must be checked by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to guarantee proper backflow prevention is in location to safeguard our drinking water during the watering season. Denver Water will send a testing reminder notice thirty days before the annual test is due.</p>
