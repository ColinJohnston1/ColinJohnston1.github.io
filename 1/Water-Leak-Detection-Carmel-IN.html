Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time in between charging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to get rid of hardness.</p>
<p>1. Install a hair-stopper - Hair-stoppers work just as their name suggests. They stop long hair from getting in and blocking your shower drain.
