<h3>Kitchen Sink Repair in Grand Prairie Texas</h2>
<p>If the baking soda and white vinegar method does not work, follow with a plunger. Fill the sink with water and strongly plunge up and down for several minutes to dislodge the clog. When dealing with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which assists apply extra pressure to the clog. For blockages that take place even more down the pipe, utilize a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable wound around a spindle with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making certain it is not clogged prior to proceeding. Take out 18 inches of cable television at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and push the auger forward at the exact same time.
