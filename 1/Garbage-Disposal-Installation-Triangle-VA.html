<p>To avoid these things from blocking your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons recommends that you utilize hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These nifty additions to your sinks and tubs can decrease the quantity of hair and food scraps that end up in your drains. Numerous garbage disposals will require a new sink drain flange, which includes the metal disk at the drain entryway at the bottom of the sink along with a short length of pipe that extends listed below the sink, where the drain attaches.</p>
<p>Changing or setting up a new garbage disposal can be a hassle, as it includes the uncomfortable, restricted work space under your sink. You'll also need to be comfortable with plumbing and electrical, as it involves both. For this factor, we highly suggest calling a pro to do the job.
