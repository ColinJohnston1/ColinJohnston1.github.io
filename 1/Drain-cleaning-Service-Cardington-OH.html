This actually depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how hard the old unit is to eliminate.

<p>Many houses or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the outer finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
