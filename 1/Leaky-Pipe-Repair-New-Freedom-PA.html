When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>

Here's how it works: During normal operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of minimized pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure.

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the needed instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can end up being infected. If permitted to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the infected water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
