For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can break or degrade.

You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
