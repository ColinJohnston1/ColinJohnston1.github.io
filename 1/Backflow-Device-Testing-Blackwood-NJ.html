<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
