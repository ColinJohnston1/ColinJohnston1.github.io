Numerous faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout.

<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media begins by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions.

<p>Poorly installed gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself job. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating & cooling. The quantity of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>Softeners generally get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently referred to as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a big red flag that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
