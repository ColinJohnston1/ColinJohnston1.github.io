The resultant gap breaks any potential siphon before it can take place, avoiding infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow variety from the reasonably easy to the complex and really sophisticated.</p>
