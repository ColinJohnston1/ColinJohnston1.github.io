They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
