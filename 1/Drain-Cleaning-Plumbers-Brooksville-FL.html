<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion describes what takes place when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This takes place since the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can trigger obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which may result in extensive home damage. Look out for wet, green spots in your yard, a consistent sewage smell in or around your home, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all typical signs of root intrusion.</p>
<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it alters the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the service. The particles of calcium combine, end up being heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Flexible gas lines are usually more effective to inflexible lines, especially in areas where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection between the supply and device. Flexible gas lines are less likely to be detached in a natural disaster which reduces the risk of a surge or fire.</p>
