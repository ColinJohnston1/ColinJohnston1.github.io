<p>When your water heater begins to leak, you need to replace it fast. We'll reveal you how to install your own gas water heater in less than a day. Even if you do not need a new hot water heater today, chances are you will within the next few years. Water heaters tend to last 7 to 15 years. If yours is getting old, this article is also for you.

The cost is roughly the very same for installing a propane gas line from the tank to the house as the cost to have gas go to the house. Find out which type of gas your house currently has. Leaking faucets such as shower valves, tub faucets and sink faucets do not get changed when repiped.</p>
<p>Electric hot water heater do have a couple of drawbacks however that deserve pointing out. Primarily, electricity is not as cheap as gas. Some utility companies charge greater rates for electricity during peak durations such as really early in the morning and at night.
