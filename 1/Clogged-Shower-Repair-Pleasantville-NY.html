<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That slow, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water stains and rust. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
