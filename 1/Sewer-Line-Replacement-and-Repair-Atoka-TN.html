<p>Waste disposal unit are an important feature in any modern-day kitchen.

<p>Most homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to rust. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external finish of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
