<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Design GFAVB - The atmospheric vacuum breaker is among the least expensive backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable system and benefit back siphonage just for non-health threat or health threat conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It needs to also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local authorities, need that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not allow the use of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can only protect against back siphonage.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and enter the valve pressure equivalent to ambient climatic requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
