An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes construction projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
