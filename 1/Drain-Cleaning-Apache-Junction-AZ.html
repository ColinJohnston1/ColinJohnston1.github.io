<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
