Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
