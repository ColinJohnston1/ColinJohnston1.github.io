<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug package that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a good chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and corrode when they get old. If so, you might need to include a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
