<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Basking Ridge NJ?</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a problem-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>
