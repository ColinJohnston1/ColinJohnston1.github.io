<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Warehouse also brings a wide selection of backflow prevention accessories. These accessories include backflow prevention system attachments, backflow device enclosures, test sets, repair parts, and insulated pouches.

<p>A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is accountable for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
