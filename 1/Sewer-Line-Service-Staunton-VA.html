<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Staunton VA</h3>
<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was often blocking. They came out and dug a brand-new path for the line connected it to the sewer and everything. It was extremely hot and I truly appreciate their hard work to allow us to use our water facilities once again. Had an excellent experience with these folks. I highly recommend their services.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, offering the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>If your water heater has actually required several repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it replaced. A great general rule for hot water heater is this: because the life-span of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
