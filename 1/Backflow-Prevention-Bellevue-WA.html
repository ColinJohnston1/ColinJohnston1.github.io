When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the contaminated water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
