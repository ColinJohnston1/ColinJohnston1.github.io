<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Franklin OH</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>A water conditioner, on the other hand, deals with hard water problems in a more ingenious method. It can change the way minerals behave while dissolved in the water. While the minerals are still present for any health benefits, they do not build up on surface areas and in plumbing components. Keeping the minerals in the water is a good thing, as long as you can stop the damaging side effects.</p>
