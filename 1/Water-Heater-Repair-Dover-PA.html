<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>A minimum of once every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can obstruct efficiency, and draining a gallon or two helps eliminate the sediment. If you find a leak and choose a patching job instead of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the exact same product and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your entire house when you spot a leak.</p>
