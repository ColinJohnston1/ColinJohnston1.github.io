<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can present problems.</p>
