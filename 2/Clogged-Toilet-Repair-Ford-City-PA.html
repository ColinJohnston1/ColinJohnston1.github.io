Harmed toilets can do some truly extensive, pricey, and ... stinky damage to a home. When something fails, and your kitchen sink draws back up, your toilet will not flush, or you can't take a shower, you need for professional support right away. That's where High 5 Plumbing can be found in. With years of market experience, we understand how to take on a wide range of drain problems.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you don't currently have one. This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
