<p>If you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a couple of times, it's a good concept to have a professional examine your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system. Typically, if you have multiple drain problems you may have a drain line break somewhere in your home or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can locate and recognize the issue so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>Backsiphonage can occur when there is an abrupt decrease in the water pressure of the circulation system, such as during fire fighting or when a water main breaks. At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can develop a suction effect and draw prospective pollutants into the drinkable (drinking) water supply. Storage tank water heaters are frequently found in most homes. Their elements are an insulated tank, generally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water till it's required. A pipe emerges from the leading to provide hot water to its destination, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain accumulation, a stopping working garbage disposal, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will usually suggest our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the seriousness of the situation. Offer us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is slow to drain.</p>
