<p>When deciding on the appropriate system security there are a number of considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation should be taken a look at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to fulfill that specific danger or need. An airplane hangar will need a really different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
