Some disposer systems do not come with a power cord attached. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case.

Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from important locations in the assembly.
