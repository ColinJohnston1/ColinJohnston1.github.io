<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral content.

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>
