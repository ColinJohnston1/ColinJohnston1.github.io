<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most obvious signs of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent serious damage to your home.
