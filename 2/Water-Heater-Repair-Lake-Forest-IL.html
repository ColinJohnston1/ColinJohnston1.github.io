<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain effectively or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Often drain repair requirements can be solved reasonably quickly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, parts of a drain might need to be taken apart, examined, and cleared prior to being replaced. Sometimes, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is necessary (like a reducer, pvc, or tailpiece  trap) to guarantee typical operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to discuss repair alternatives.</p>
<p>Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far easier to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
