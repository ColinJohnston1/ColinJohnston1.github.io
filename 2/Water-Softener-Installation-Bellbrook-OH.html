<h3>Plumbing, Heating & Air Conditioning In Bellbrook OH</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow occurs. No, it is not a frequent event, however it does occur more frequently than you think! Often it happens at night when you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a new pipe. This makes building projects easily the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common cause of backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, use or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers need to be checked periodically to ensure they are functioning appropriately. A visual check of air gaps suffices, however mechanical backflow preventers have to be tested with correctly adjusted gauge devices.</p>
