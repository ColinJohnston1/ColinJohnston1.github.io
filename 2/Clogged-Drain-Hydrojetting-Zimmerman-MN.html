<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is important that only original factory repair parts are utilized. The rubber parts the producer produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
