<p>A backflow preventer is a means or system to prevent backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The fundamental mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>Before choice and installation, refer to producers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies must be protected from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be used. Speak with makers specs for suggestions. When looking for plumbing services in the area, specify with your needs and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the innovative experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
