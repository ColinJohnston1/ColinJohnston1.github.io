<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized assessments consist of specialized camera equipment that encounters your sewer line. A camera inspection is much more palatable than trenching through the yard if you have actually spotted pooling water in the backyard. This will cost you (usually) in between $300-$ 400.

In addition, a master plumber also needs to pass a state sanctioned test.</p>
