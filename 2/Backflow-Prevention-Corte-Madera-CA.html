<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal circulation in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can occur when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>For shallow pipes with no neighboring energies or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your harmed pipe runs under your driveway, any big trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining could save you as much as $10,000 in repair costs, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>
