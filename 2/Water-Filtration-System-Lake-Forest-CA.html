I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
