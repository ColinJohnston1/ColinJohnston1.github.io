<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller model that operated on the very same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break since you can smell nasty smells or you have a sewage back-up in your house.

Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the issue. The technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance real estate agent, city or company inspector.</p>
<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
