<p>And so, we see the transition from substantial transportation pipelines (aqueducts) providing water to entire cities to big circulation pipes (mains) servicing smaller communities or big centers, to medium distribution pipelines and finally to little service pipelines. Each phase in the water system and circulation system needs to handle differing circulation rates, circulation speeds and pressure heads, along with different levels of direct exposure to potential backwash or pollutant seepage and the subsequent need for security with backflow preventers.</p>
<p>If you have delicate skin, eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis or dry winter season itch it's a great idea to switch a precipitating water softener for a non-precipitating water softener.
