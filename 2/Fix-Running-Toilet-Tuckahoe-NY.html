<p>At least when every three months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder performance, and draining a gallon or so helps remove the sediment. If you identify a leak and select a patching task rather of a repiping job, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are probably made from the same product and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your whole house when you identify a leak.</p>
