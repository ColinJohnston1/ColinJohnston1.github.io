Many of them use foam insulation instead of the conventional fiberglass.</p>

<p>Next comes the metal install ring and rubber cushion install (or cushion ring). Their right orientation will be identified. When correctly fitted together hold the install ring and disposal in place, these two pieces have complementary grooves that. Holding the mount ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, ensuring that the rubber of the cushion mount is completely and strongly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When installed correctly, you should not be able to eliminate the cushion mount without significant extending and pulling, and the install ring must turn easily around it.</p>
