<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Wrightsville PA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
