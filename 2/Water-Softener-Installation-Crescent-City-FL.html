I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
