After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or debris.

It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to ensure the line is correctly flushed.</p>
