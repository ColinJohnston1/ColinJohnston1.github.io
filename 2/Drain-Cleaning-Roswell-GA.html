However if your toilet is showing any of the following indications, it might be time to replace it.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
