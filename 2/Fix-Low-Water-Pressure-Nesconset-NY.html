<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The basic ways of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The basic system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
