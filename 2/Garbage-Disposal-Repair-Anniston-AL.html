<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Anniston AL</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Regrettably, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these problems.</p>
