The innovation is easier and more cost-effective than other softening systems on the market today that utilize zeolites, which should be restored using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that needs significant water usage and high pressure.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
