<p>Inside the home, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for drips or leaks. Inspect beneath sinks to look for leaking pipes. Local plumber quoted price of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ pleased I inspected around. Under the sink, put a pail or pan beneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen up the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
