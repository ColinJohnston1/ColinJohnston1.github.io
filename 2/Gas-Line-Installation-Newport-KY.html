Disposers can be dropped in their tracks by celery, eggshells and apple seeds, in addition to the usual kitchen flotsam, including pop-tabs, searching pads and twist-ties. While some older houses may not have backflow preventers, all newer homes are needed to have them. If you're not exactly sure what sort of backflow preventers are utilized in your home or company, Doug's can assist you locate and determine them. We can also perform your yearly backflow inspections.</p>

An air gap on a swimming pool refill pipe needs to be quickly available for inspection and satisfy the rigorous definition of an air gap as specified in plumbing codes and state regulations. Refill lines and the backflow preventer type and area must be shown on swimming pool construction plans.</p>
