A plumber will insert a specially created waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to figure out where and what the source of the problem is.</p>

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>A few of the reasons for drain line blockages in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a failing garbage disposal, or excessive food being disposed down the drain. We will usually advise our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending upon the severity of the scenario. Give us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells nasty, or is slow to drain.</p>
