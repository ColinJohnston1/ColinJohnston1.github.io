<p>Surprise water leakages are often difficult and have Possibly Severe Repercussions. Replacing your flapper may need slightly different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
