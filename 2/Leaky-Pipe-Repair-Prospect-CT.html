<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive Prospect CT</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, discharging from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of debris such as tough water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
