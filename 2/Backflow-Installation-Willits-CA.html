<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. It usually indicates wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up when this happens. If you think of what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unclean and will also eventually trigger pressure on other parts of your waste disposal unit. The kitchen sink drain might need an easy tightening up or a replacement. If the leak is in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the apparent spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you might have to fill the sink with water before analyzing the pipe below.</p>

Sanford & Boy plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding areas. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
