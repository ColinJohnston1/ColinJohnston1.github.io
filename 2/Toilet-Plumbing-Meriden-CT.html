They were extremely responsive and prompt to send me a quote which was very competitive. They were extremely professional and did an incredible job.

Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still an issue that needs to be handled right away (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
