<p>Tankless water heaters are likewise sustained by gas or electricity, however they do not store water within the system. They are compact and just heat water as needed, making them more eco-friendly. Tankless water heaters generally need a greater initial financial investment, but they are less pricey to operate and offer additional benefits like endless warm water.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were prompt and extremely responsive to send me a quote which was extremely competitive. They were very professional and did an amazing job.

This is obviously still an issue that requires to be handled right now (you'll likely need a new water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>

If your water heater is past its typical life-span (typically anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a significant leak or comprehensive rust, it may be time to consider replacement.</p>
<p>Say you choose to go that path. The next concern is whether or not you can install it yourself. Put it this way, if you're a skilled useful person, but you've never handled this specific repair, you can probably do it, supplying you do your homework.

<p>Other signs you might need to repipe consist of rust in your water system, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not always imply repiping is the only solution. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the issue to identify the best strategy.</p>
