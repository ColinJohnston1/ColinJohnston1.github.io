<p>. Backflow into a public water supply can contaminate or pollute the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water because system risky or unusable to consume), and each water provider has a responsibility to offer water that is usable and safe to consume under all foreseeable situations.

<p>Repiping is not a temporary fix. It's a permanent option for the entire plumbing system in your home or business.

When the system passes our tests, it's good to opt for you.</p>

Loosen up the nuts that connect the drain pipe, including the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Utilize your hands for PVC connections or a monkey wrench for metal connections. Place a container beneath the drain pipe to catch any water that leakages out.</p>
