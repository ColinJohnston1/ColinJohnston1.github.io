<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Syracuse UT</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
