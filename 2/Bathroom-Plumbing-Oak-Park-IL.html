<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, along with inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
