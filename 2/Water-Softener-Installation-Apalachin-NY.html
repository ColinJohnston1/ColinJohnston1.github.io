The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood.
