Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
