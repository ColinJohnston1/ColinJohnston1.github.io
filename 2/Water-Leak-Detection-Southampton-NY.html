<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Services in Southampton</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Surprise water leaks are frequently stressful and have Potentially Serious Effects. Changing your flapper may require slightly different actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, however chances are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Photo 1. If extra pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running noise, water is most likely escaping through a broken or rusted overflow tube. In that case, you need to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Since the overflow tube is seldom the cause of a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>
