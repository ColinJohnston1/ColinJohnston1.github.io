If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and rust.
