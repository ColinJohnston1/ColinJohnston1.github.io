<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the required instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, as well as checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
