<p>To prep your system for installation, you might have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I purchased individually from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>To eliminate the cable from the old disposer, use a screwdriver to eliminate the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the system. Detach the wire nuts and pull the cord through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons provides yearly examinations on your sewer and septic tanks. Our service technicians thoroughly examine your entire drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to avoid future problems before they occur. Our annual maintenance services also include comprehensive drain cleaning to keep your pipes clear.</p>
