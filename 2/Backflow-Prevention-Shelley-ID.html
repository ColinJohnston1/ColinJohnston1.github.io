<p>Woodbury, in addition to many other communities and organizations, has found the very best way to avoid these spots from taking place is by reducing the number of times your water softener regrows. "Regrowing" refers to the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "exhausted" or full. Nevertheless, lots of water softeners restore too often, when the filter medium really isn't complete. This can be corrected by simply resetting your water softener to remove less solidity or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>
