Fire defense system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely various, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be designed and installed to satisfy that specific hazard or need.

The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also differ greatly.</p>
