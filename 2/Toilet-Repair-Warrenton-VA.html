Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that doesn't work. A number of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely damaging if it can be found in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the appropriate safety measures.</p>
