If your toilet was manufactured before 1994, you could be squandering cash with every flush. Older toilets use up to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern standard. A Broken Dip Tube: The dip tube is utilized to vent all of the fresh water from the water line to the bottom of your tank so that it can warm much faster.

Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals bring favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, drinkable and watering, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
