<h3>How To Select A Credible Plumber Westmont IL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
