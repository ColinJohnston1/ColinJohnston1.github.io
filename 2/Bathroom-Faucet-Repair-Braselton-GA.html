When the motor stops working entirely, another time that a replacement will be necessary is.</p>
<p>If you see rust only in your hot water, then check the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. You might need a professional to do this if you've never ever done this on your own.

With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
