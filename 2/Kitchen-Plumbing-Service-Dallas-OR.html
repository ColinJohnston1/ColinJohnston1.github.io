<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll discover that water runs to refill the bowl. However, in a correctly working toilet, the water needs to stop running once the bowl is filled to its proper capability. Possibilities are you have an internal leak and water is being discarded down the overflow if your toilet continues to run. These leaks are incredibly wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
