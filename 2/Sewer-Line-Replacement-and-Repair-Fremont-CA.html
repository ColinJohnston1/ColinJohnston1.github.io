I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
