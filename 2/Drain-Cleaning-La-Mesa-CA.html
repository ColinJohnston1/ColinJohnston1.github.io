<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? In some cases you need to replace a sink-- when an enamel sink is severely damaged, or when any sink is leaking. And often you're just all set for a kitchen update. If you want several sinks in your house to  have soft water for easier meal washing, under-sink and countertop softeners can help.
