<p>Some makers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most disastrous and prevalent water problems: hard water.  Difficult water damaged the modern-day home. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice machines. Tough water damages hot water appliances. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
