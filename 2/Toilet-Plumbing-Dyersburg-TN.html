<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Dyersburg TN</h3>
<p>Water softeners leaks are primarily triggered because of a concern at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal might likewise be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is likely split and simply needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
