Newer units utilize computerized sensors that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water usage and therefore only regenerate when required. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect because they save energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
