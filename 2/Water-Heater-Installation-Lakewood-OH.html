<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Lakewood OH</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains considerable amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of intended uses around your house.</p>
