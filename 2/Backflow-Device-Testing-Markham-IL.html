Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however chances are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Products") or search online.</p>
