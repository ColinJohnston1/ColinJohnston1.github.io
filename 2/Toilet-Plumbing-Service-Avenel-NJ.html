<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous designated uses around your house.</p>
<p>The Battelle Research study likewise found difficult water to quickly result in clogged shower heads, in some cases after just a year and a half of regular use. After just one week of continuous testing with difficult water, more than three-fourths of shower head nozzles ended up being clogged, according to laboratory results.

Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures.
