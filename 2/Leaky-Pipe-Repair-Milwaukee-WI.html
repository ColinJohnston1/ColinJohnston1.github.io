An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can occur through a procedure known as backflow.</p>

The choice "to soften or not to soften" refers personal choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
