<p>. Backflow into a public water system can infect the water or pollute in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system unusable or unsafe to consume), and each water supplier has an obligation to provide water that is functional and safe to consume under all foreseeable circumstances. Additionally, customers generally have absolute faith that water delivered to them through a public water supply is constantly safe to drink. For these factors, your water district must take precautions to secure its public water system versus backflow.</p>
