<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Conshohocken PA</h3>
<p>Do you need Leesburg VA sink repairs? Kiddco Plumbing can assist! Repairing, changing or setting up a brand-new sink is among those jobs that's a little harder to get done right than it seems. What looks like an easy task frequently turns into a weekend long hassle trying to fit the new sink into the opening, line up the supply of water lines and drain pipes, install the faucets and other fixtures, and put the whole thing together so that the new sink is firmly secured in location, all the plumbing fits and work properly and none of the water system lines or drains leak.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
