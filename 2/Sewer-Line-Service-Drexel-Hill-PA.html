<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has area to hang on to positive ions. The fresh media starts by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
