<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
