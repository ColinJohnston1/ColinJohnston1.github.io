<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>If you have sensitive skin, eczema, psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis or dry winter season itch it's a very good idea to change a speeding up water softener for a non-precipitating water softener. Non-precipitating water softeners do not increase the alkalinity of water and do not leave behind a residue which could collect inside of your energies. Is your old hot water heater breaking down?
