<p>Release piping connected to a storm sewer will be equipped with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices advises a DCV assembly on wet or dry lawn sprinkler unless there is a danger of a high-hazard cross-connection.

<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
