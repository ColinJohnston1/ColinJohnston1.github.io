<p>A working drainage and sewer system requires the correct installation of a skilled professional.

<p>Idea: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and check the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you see water reappearing in your sink or shower? This might imply that the water does not have a clear course to do through, more than likely because of a blocked drain.

<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can acquire models with special features that do whatever however include the salt, you will pay for each additional function.
