<p>Backflow preventers should just be fixed when the data collected from the field test indicates the assembly has actually degraded in its performance listed below the established minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This means the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
