<p>Check the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust only in your hot water. You may need a professional to do this if you have actually never ever done this on your own. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is probably coming from the within your hot water heater. Replace your hot water heater as soon as possible if this is the case.
