<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Salem MA</h3>
<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion refers to what happens when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens because the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can cause clogs, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to substantial home damage. Watch out for damp, green patches in your lawn, a relentless sewage smell in or around your home, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all typical indications of root intrusion.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
