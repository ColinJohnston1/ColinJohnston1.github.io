Bottom line: Difficult water can make cosmetic and domestic cleaning products less reliable. This can lead to inflamed skin or even a broken washing machine. It's why a lot of cleaning products today include chelating representatives or other types of water softeners.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can buy designs with unique features that do everything however add the salt, you will spend for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm warranty that the unique feature will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or sanitize bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Lastly, if you own a septic system, you must consider the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regrowth cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
