<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly begins. For a three-bedroom home and family of four, regeneration normally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
