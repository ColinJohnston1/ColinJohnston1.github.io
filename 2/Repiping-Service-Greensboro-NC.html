<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at Greensboro NC</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its numerous designated uses around your house.</p>
