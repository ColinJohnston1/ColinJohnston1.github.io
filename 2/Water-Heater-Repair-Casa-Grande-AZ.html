<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these elements, as well as arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>

The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively utilized in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
