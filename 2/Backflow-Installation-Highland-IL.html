<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your family safe from the potential dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not develop cross connections in the very first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, pool, water function or other type of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>Backpressure may occur when the potable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not correctly secured, non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be pushed into the drinkable supply system.</p>
