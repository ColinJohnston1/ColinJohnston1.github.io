Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
