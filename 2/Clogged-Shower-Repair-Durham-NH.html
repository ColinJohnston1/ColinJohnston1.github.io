<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Durham NH</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
