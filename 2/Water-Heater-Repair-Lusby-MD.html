<p>Do you notice that you have flaky or dry skin, or does your water have a chemical or rotten egg odor? When there are cracks or holes in your sewer line, sewer line repair is advised. Replacement of the line is suggested if damage is extreme. Bonney's professional plumbers can rapidly retrofit your sink and install a new instant hot water heater together with an elegant instant hot water faucet to match your kitchen design. 2 From below, place the washers and gaskets according to the manufacturer's directions. Slip the installing ring onto the flange then move on the snap ring up until it snaps into place. Equally tighten up the three installing bolts, sealing the flange tightly versus the sink. Remove excess plumber's putty.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Photo 1. If extra pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running noise, water is most likely escaping through a cracked or rusted overflow tube. In that case, you need to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the whole flush valve. Since the overflow tube is seldom the reason for a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>
