Based on research performed by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Research Study, 2011.</p>

A batch feed waste disposal unit costs more than a continuous-feed disposal however is great for putting security initially. It runs in batches and has a cover over the disposal entrance, requiring that you put the food into the disposal and then flip a switch to grind the food. Only a handful of types are readily available due to their cost.</p>
<p>Drain pipe is not protected utilizing the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe must be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe.
