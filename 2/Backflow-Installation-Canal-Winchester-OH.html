<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Usually, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can position problems.</p>
