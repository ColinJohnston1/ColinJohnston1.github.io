<p>Backflow preventers are critical for creating a safe supply of water system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be correctly maintained. The brine option need to be blended and stored in the salt water tank. Routine clogging of the resin also needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, regular backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Likewise, fungi and germs also form mats in the resin that lower its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these problems. Nevertheless, check out the producer's directions prior to adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>
