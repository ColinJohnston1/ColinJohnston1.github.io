<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Davidson NC</h3>
<p>Low hot water pressure? Our experienced plumbers can determine and resolve your low water pressure issue. Signs of rust or scale buildup on fixtures may suggest past leaks and high pressure. This can lead plumbers to investigate if there is a larger problem needing attention. Dealing with gas is extremely dangerous, and it is necessary to switch off the line to permit a safe repair procedure.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Roots of trees can grow into sewer lines, even through extremely little openings. If you believe root development has triggered a clog or damage to your sewer line, call Stutzman Services. Our Drain Cleaning Expert can examine, diagnose and repair the damage. The following are the most frequently asked questions about gas line installation, gas line connections, and the cost to run gas lines to a home.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
