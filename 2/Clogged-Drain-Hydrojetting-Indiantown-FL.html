<p>When deciding on the proper system security there are a number of considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be looked at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system.

Fire defense system are developed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are installed in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be really various, we need to comprehend that the fire security system for any installation needs to be created and installed to satisfy that particular danger or need. An airplane garage will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would likewise vary significantly.</p>
