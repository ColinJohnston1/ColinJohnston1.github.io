<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
