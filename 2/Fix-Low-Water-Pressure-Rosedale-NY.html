The drain will gradually slow until it ends up being completely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in stores have actually limited effectiveness. Although the drain may seem to clear at first, the outcome is typically short-lived and the clog quickly returns. Using these chemicals often can trigger damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly.

You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
