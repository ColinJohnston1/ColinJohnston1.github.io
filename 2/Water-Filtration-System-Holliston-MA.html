<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and built a smaller sized design that ran on the same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also developed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>

Due to this lime scale accumulation, pipes are blocked and the efficiency of hot boilers and tanks is minimized. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent.
