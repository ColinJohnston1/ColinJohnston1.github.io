<p>Severe rust, or rusty water, might suggest the tank will need to be changed.

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).

With this technique, you know the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
