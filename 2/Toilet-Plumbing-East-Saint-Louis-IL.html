To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace.

The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
