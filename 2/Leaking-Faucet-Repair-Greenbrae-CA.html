<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
