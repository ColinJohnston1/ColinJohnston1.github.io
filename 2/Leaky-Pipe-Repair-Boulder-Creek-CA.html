<p>Inspecting the condition, water, and age lines to the water heater can help plumbers understand many things, including water pressure and signs of leakages. It can likely last beyond its standard warranty if the water heater has actually been kept with yearly flush service. All secondary sources of water, such as wells or plumbing systems that are exposed to possible contamination or poorer quality water, require a backflow prevention device.</p>
