While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
