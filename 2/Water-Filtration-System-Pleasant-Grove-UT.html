<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
