<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally maintained at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened).
