<p>Concealed water leakages are often difficult and have Possibly Serious Repercussions. Changing your flapper might need a little different steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate among the exact same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

We made the decision to stay with Joe, despite the fact that we felt Mr Rooter rates were certainly on the high end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
