<p>This is the traditional question that lots of homeowners ask themselves. Is it much better to repair their pipes or repipe them and begin fresh? The answer is completely depending on your unique situation. For example, if your pipe is experiencing a little leak but remains in otherwise great condition, we would suggest fixing it. However, if the pipe is constantly leaking and needs frequent repairs, we would suggest repiping. At Super Plumbers, we never ever suggest services or products that would not truly benefit the consumer.</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most common and terrible water problems: difficult water.  Hard water damaged the modern home. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly shortens the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice makers. Difficult water ruins warm water home appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
