<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can achieve this.</p>
