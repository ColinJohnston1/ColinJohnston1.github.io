As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others.

After they offered me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
