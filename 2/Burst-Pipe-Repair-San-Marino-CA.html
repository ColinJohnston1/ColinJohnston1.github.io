<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, however how do they work and which styles are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are defined by local statutes and ecological guidelines. Local building regulations for instance will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon prior to it can happen, avoiding contaminating water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more sophisticated and complex backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the reasonably easy to the complex and extremely advanced.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
