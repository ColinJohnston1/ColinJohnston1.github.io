<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent.

This triggers the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and enter the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
