We supply gas hot water heater service, along with electric water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>Poorly set up gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the best levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating and cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
