The predetermined number represents the quantity of time between each regeneration. For example, a lower selected number means your softener will restore less frequently.

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most terrible and prevalent water problems: tough water.  Hard water ruined the contemporary home. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the lifespan of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee makers and ice makers.
