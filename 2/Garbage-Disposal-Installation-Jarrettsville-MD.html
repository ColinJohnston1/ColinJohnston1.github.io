Instead of a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
