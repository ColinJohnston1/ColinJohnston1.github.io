However if your toilet is exhibiting any of the following signs, it may be time to replace it. When a water account is developed, we evaluate backflow requirements for companies on a specific basis. After getting rid of standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mixture.</p>
