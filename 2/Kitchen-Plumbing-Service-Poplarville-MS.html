<p>Many plumbers will eliminate the old system to install the new one at the same hourly rate. This can increase the quantity of time required to install the new unit, for that reason increasing expenses. This really depends on what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how hard the old unit is to get rid of. In most cases, elimination will just add an extra $25 to $50 to the overall costs, but in many cases the expenses could be greater if extra pipes need to also be replaced.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it replaced if your water heater has needed several repairs over the last couple of years.

If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
