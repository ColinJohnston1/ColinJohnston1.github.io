Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.

The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood.
