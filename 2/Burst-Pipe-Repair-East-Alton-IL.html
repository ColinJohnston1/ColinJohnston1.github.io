<p>Water softeners can be found in all sizes and shapes and bigger absolutely does not mean much better. WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller beads that really provide more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capacity in a minimum of area. Plus, our trademarked Directional Flow Screen system assists guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise secure the resin bed, so we don't need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regrowth to launch hardness, sediment and dirt.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't bring in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom home and household of four, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
