<p>Most residential homes have roofing system gutters that flow into downspout drains that direct water far from the house. When those downspouts are linked to underground drains that circulation to local storm drains or street gutters, they in some cases become clogged with tree roots and debris.

<p>Many toilets used today run with a basic gravity flushing style, implying they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewer system.
