More recent units utilize electronic sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other crucial metrics based upon your water usage and therefore only regrow when required. These newer systems, also referred to as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect due to the fact that they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
