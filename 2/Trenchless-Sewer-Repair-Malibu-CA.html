An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction jobs quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants.

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be properly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
