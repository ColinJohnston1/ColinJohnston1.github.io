<h3>Pipe Leak Repair in Selbyville Delaware</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least three efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles went down the freshly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
