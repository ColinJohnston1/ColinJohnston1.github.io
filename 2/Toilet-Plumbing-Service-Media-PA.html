<p>Howard, the Project Manager, has actually constantly been informative and valuable regarding all our issues. He did the proposal and set up the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair without delay. It is always a pleasure to deal with him.

He is always enjoyable, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>
<h3>Drain Clearing in Media Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the damaged fuel lines. When you pull the fuel lines from the trimmer, a little cylindrical fuel line filter will pop off the thin line leading into the tank.
