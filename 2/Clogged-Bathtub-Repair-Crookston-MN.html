Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.
