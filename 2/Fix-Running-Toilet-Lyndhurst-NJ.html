<p>Everyday usage need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the unit in a steady and safe place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and after that checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You need to also check to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
