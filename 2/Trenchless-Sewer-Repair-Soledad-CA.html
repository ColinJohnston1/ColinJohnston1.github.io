No, it is not a frequent event, but it does take place more frequently than you think! Typically it takes place at night when you do not see the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire combating is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This typically triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
