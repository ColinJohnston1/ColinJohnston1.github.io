<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous decades, but steel ultimately struggles with deterioration and does not have the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
