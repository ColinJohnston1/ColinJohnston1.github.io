<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which designs are best for particular applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by ecological guidelines and local statutes. Local building regulations for instance will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any possible siphon prior to it can take place, preventing polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can need the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the style of these mechanical devices installed to avoid backflow range from the relatively simple to the complex and very advanced.</p>
