This can be tricky, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around.

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If allowed to re-enter the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, along with checked every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
