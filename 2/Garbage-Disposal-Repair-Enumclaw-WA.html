<p>SofTap's water softening innovation is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale accumulation in homes and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, in addition to improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is easier and more economical than other softening systems on the market today that utilize zeolites, which need to be regrowed utilizing brine, or membrane nanofiltration that requires substantial water usage and high pressure.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, providing the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>

When you include a water softener, it eliminates the mineral material to produce odor free drinking water that tastes great.</p>
