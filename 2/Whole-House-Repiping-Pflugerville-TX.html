<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
