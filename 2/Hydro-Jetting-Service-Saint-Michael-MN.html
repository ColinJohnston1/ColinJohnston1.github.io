To prevent corrosion from rust, tank are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod safeguards the tank by drawing in harmful materials. By having the anode rod checked regularly and changed as required, you can double the life of your hot water heater.</p>

These nifty additions to your tubs and sinks can decrease the amount of hair and food scraps that wind up in your drainpipes. Numerous waste disposal unit will require a brand-new sink drain flange, which consists of the metal disk at the drain entrance at the bottom of the sink as well as a brief length of pipe that extends listed below the sink, where the drain connects.</p>
