This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your house. Even if the problem originates with the municipal system, it's still wise to generate the professionals to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic tank from your home. Then that generally suggests that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in numerous drains at once in your home. This can happen in several areas and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from several drain lines in your home.</p>
