The typical labor cost to install a gas line is $3 to $11 per direct foot depending on the size of the pipe and task intricacy.

<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water boiler, dishwasher, and heater, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In severe cases, hard-water deposits can considerably restrict the water circulation, which puts unnecessary pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
