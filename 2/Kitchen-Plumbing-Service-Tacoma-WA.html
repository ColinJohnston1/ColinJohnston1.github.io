<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
