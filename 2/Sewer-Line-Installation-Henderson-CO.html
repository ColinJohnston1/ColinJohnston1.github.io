<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water home appliances? This is a great sign that your pipes might be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be replaced. Bear in mind that if the rust-colored water only features warm water, the cause might be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your house's piping.</p>
