<p>After getting here after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however declared they would not take duty if it dripped now because of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, given that I never ever wish to see this company once again.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as many plumbers do, to use disposals sparingly. Correct care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
