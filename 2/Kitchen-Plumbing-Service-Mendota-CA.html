<p>Electric water heaters do have a few disadvantages however that deserve mentioning. First and foremost, electricity is not as low-cost as gas. Some utility companies charge greater rates for electrical power during peak durations such as extremely early in the morning and in the evening. Utilizing your heater during these peak periods can increase your power expenses. On the hand, gas is low-cost and has a fixed rate. Another downside of an electrical hot water heater is that they can be costly to install, specifically when it concerns whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>At least when every three months, drain water from the tank. In time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or two helps get rid of the sediment. If you spot a leak and opt for a patching task instead of a repiping job, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same product and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire house when you find a leak.</p>
