<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Amesbury MA</h3>
<p>The most reliable method to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
