<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
