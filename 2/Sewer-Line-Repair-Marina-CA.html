Water pressure might fail or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
