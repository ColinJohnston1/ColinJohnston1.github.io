<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the building; extra, more significant expenses can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being an issue for citizens. If installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help determine.</p>
