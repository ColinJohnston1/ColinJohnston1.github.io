Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
