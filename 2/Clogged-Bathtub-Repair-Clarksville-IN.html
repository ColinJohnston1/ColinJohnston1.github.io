<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
