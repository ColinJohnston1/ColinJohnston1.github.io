<h3>Tips On Basic Plumbing Emergencies Citrus Heights CA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be required to be located on the water service line, within the building, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer checked on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>There are several indications to watch out for. 1) The surface of the floor in one area is warm and even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all devices and fixtures in your home have actually been shut off. 3) The water heater seems to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to greater gas and water bills, sometimes extremely quickly.</p>
