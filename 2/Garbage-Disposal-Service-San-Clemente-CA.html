<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumber San Clemente CA</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
