<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection demands. With time, like any other home appliance in your home, your garbage disposal. may need repairs. A disposal system might clog or begin to leak through heavy, or inappropriate, use. A leak someplace in the system may indicate a worn seal. In some cases, we can replace that seal; otherwise, we'll need to replace the whole system. This is where the UPC truly comes into play.
