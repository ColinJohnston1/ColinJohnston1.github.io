Worms for irrigation systems: Residents found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground lawn sprinkler. Throughout a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system drew some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The homeowner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to shower his child.</p>
<p>It's quite typical for particles to wind up being flushed down our drains. Think about how typically food particles, cooking oil and hair winds up in our showers and sinks.

This can lead to a number of problems, from foul smells to water leakages and burst pipes.</p>

<p>For convenience, better health and ecological duty, adding a garbage disposal to your kitchen is the very best response to food waste.
