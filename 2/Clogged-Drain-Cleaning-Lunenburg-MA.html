<h3>Five Things To Do Today To Avoid A Clogged Toilet in Lunenburg MA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
