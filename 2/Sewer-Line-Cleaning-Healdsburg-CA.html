Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.

Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
