<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
