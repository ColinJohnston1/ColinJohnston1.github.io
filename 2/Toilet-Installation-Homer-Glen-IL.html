Dissolved calcium and magnesium speed up out of hard water as scale, which develops on the within pipes, hot water heater, tea kettles, coffee makers and industrial machinery. Scale decreases circulation through pipes and is a poor conductor of heat. Ultimately, pipes can end up being totally clogged.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
