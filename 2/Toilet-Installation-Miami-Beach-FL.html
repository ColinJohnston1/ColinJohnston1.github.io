<p>Corrosion is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate rust Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of deterioration control. Therefore, considering all these factors, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
