<p>390 Last Plumbing: All plumbing components should be installed and properly working, all hot and cold water faucets need to be functional. All drains must be set up and connected. The cost to install a garbage disposal in Florida varies anywhere from $325 to $1,000.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
