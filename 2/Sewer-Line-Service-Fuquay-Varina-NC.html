<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Per Hour Fuquay Varina NC</h3>

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
