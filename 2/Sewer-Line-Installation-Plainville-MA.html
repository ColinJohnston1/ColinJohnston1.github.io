After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are mainly time related. If whatever is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be modified, replaced, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and for that reason the overall expenses. Most plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for three hours total, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
