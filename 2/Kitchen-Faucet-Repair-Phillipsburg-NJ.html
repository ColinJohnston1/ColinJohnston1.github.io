When the pressure drops for some factor such as might occur when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation happens, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention method made use of. The best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air space is not possible, then the appropriate backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
