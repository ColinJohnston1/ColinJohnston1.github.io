When you pick Pinky's plumbing for your gas installation requires, you can rest assured that our technicians have gone through an extensive hands on training program and will have the understanding and knowledge to install or repair your gas system in a timely and efficient  manner.</p>
<p>The repair service technician must be able to determine the many various makers and the particular designs produced over the years. Some designs may seem similar on the outdoors but could require different repair parts on the inside, so the repair specialist should have the ability to recognize the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that may have been produced.

<p>Drain pipe is not protected using the required solvent cement (end of the pipe need to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe.
